#is and is not are two identity operators used is python programming

#"is" works as "==" operator is C means it will return ture if the argument will must be true else false

#similary the "is not" it will return ture if the argument will must be false else ture

a = 10
b = 10
print(a is b) #"is" operator
print(a == b) #realtional operator is also similar to "is"

print(a is not b)#"is not" operator
print(a != b) #realtional operator is also similar to "is not"
